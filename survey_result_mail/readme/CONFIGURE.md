To configure automatic result sending to the user:

1.  Go to the survey you want to configure.
2.  In the *Options* tab, you'll find a new *Send survey answers* option
    that you can set on to send an automatic email with the user's
    answers.
3.  You can also choose which mail template to send. This module
    provides two. One with the answers inlined and another with the
    answers attached as pdf report.
