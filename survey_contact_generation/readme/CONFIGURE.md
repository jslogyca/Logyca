To configure the contact generation:

1.  Go to the configured survey.
2.  In the *Contact* section of the *Options* tab, set *Generate
    Contact* on, if you want contacts to be generated from the answers
    to this survey.
3.  If you want the generated to have a parent company, set the option
    *Create Parent Contact* and link the company_name field to a
    question in the survey.
4.  In each question associated with a future new contact, specify the
    corresponding contact field. To do this, go to the 'Options' tab,
    then navigate to the 'Contact' group, and select the 'Contact field'
    field.
